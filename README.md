A fully customizable multi-layer neural network written in Python. Built from scratch without external machine learning libraries, this tool enables clean data preprocessing, flexible model configuration, and robust training using advanced gradient descent algorithms.
## 🌟 Key Features
---

- Fully self-coded neural network layers with backpropagation
- Support for **Adam**, **RMSprop**, **SGD**, **Batch** and **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**
- Complete custom data preprocessing including:
  - Standardization (`Z-Score`, `Mean-Score`)
  - Normalization, Log Scaling
  - One-Hot Encoding & Label Encoding
- Configurable network architecture (number of layers, activations, etc.)
- Modular design with separated **Layer** and **Network** classes
- Data shuffling across epochs to prevent overfitting and leakage
- Built-in data validation utilities
